# Glassmorphism Login Page

This is a sleek and modern login page featuring a glassmorphism design. Built using only HTML and CSS, the form showcases subtle animations, icon-enhanced fields, and a frosted-glass-style container over a background image. It's fully responsive and designed for front-end development practice.
